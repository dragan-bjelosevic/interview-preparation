Description:
    Defines an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but lets subclasses decide upon which class to instantiate
Type:
    Creational
When to use:
    - we want to decouple client (user class) from the object creation
    - we want to delegate object creation to subclasses
    - exact object type is not known until runtime
