React re-renders component when:
- its state changes
- its parent re-renders and passes the new props
- a context value that component consumes changes

If parent re-renders child will re-render even when props are the same (unless we wrap the child in React.memo)
For state and context variables React compares new values with the old values using Object.is comparison - REFERENTIAL INTEGRITY
Primitive values work great but object and arrays will only be compared by reference.
