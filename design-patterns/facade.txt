Description: 
    Provides simlified interface to a complex set of classes (e.g. library or a framework)
Type:
    Structural
When to use:
    - when we need to hide complex set of classes and provide simpler interface for the client
    - when we break subsystem into layers and enable communication between layers only through facades
    - when we break monolith into modular monolith architecture and provide only facade to other modules
